# Recovery_builder

hi there , this script is made by me.Im AndVer0

ok first before blaming my script if you got a bootloop or the build is unsuccessfull. check your device tree

1) froke

2) edit config.sh

3) read comments and edit required values to your own

4) enable actions if isnt enabled with write permission to perform (save the build)

5) run

# Recovery_builder

hi there , this script is made by me.Im AndVer0

ok first before blaming my script if you got a bootloop or the build is unsuccessfull. check your device tree

1) froke

2) go to .github/workflows/"recovery".yml

3) read commentary and edit required values to your own

4) enable actions if isnt enabled

5) run

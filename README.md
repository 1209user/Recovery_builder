# Recovery_builder

hi there , this script is made by me. its based on another repo called ubuntu ssh using gh actions so enjoy

ok first before blaming my script if you got a bootloop or the build is unsuccessfully the problem is from you that bcz:
   

   *) you didnt fill the right info
   *) from device tree
   *) you added edited my script

1) froke

2) go to .github/workflows/"recovery".yml

3) read commentary and edit required values to your own

4) enable actions if isnt enabled

5) run
